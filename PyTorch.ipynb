When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"njkw2nenD_10","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730081756935,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Priya Balakrishnan","userId":"14250973744550261759"}},"outputId":"ceff0bf1-4f5b-4d79-9b49-08c548824f80"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Before flattening:  tensor([[[[ 0,  1],\n","          [ 2,  3],\n","          [ 4,  5]]],\n","\n","\n","        [[[ 6,  7],\n","          [ 8,  9],\n","          [10, 11]]]])\n","After flattening:  tensor([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5],\n","        [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11]])\n"]}],"source":["def flatten(x):\n","    N = x.shape[0] # read in N, C, H, W\n","    return x.view(N, -1)  # \"flatten\" the C * H * W values into a single vector per image\n","\n","def test_flatten():\n","    x = torch.arange(12).view(2, 1, 3, 2)\n","    print('Before flattening: ', x)\n","    print('After flattening: ', flatten(x))\n","\n","test_flatten()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vcLRlPYgD_10"},"source":["### Barebones PyTorch: Two-Layer Network\n","\n","Here we define a function `two_layer_fc` which performs the forward pass of a two-layer fully-connected ReLU network on a batch of image data.

You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input
